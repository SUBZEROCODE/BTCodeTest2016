Instructions to compile Java code.

Note: There are several Java classes- I split program execution for modularity/readability purposes.

1) Extract code from .zip file by extracting it with password btcodetest.

2) Compile all Java code using "javac *.java".

2) Run the RouterCheck class(this can be thought of as the main interface) using "java RouterCheck sample.csv".
