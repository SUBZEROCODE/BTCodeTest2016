Instructions to compile Java code.

Note: There are 4 Java classes- I split program execution for modularity/readability purposes.

1) Navigate to \src\main\java for the java code files. N.B Test files are found in \src\test\java

2) Compile all Java code inside this folder with "javac *.java".

3) Run the RouterCheck class(this can be thought of as the main interface) using "java RouterCheck sample.csv".

OR Run sample tests by using "mvn test" (maven test build).

Additional information:

I have experimented with the Continous Integration tool "Travis CI" to test a Java 8 linux platform online.

I have integrated my knowledge of Maven and also JUnit to perform some unit tests and add dependancies.
