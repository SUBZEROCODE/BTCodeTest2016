Instructions to compile Java code.

Note: There are 4 Java classes- I split program execution for modularity/readability purposes.

1) Navigate to \src\main\java for the java code files.

2) Compile all Java code inside this folder with "javac *.java".

3) Run the RouterCheck class(this can be thought of as the main interface) using "java RouterCheck sample.csv".

4) Run tests by using maven test
